# CAPE
Cellular Automata Pixel simulation 2D game Engine

# THIS PROJECT IS A PROTOTYPE FOR [RAIN](https://github.com/jaks024/rain) 

## Current Goal
Dynamically drawn map made with simulated pixel objects that reacts to its surrounding environemnt. 

## TO-DOS - Main Points (Short Term)
- Game Object Management (Works)
- Rendering (Works)
- UI (Can display text with background color)
  - Debug UI
- Audio
- Cellular Automata Base Components (base structure done)
- Attachable Components
  - Colliders
- Simple testing tools 
  - Object Painter (Works)
